# Assignment 8: Quote of the Day  
### Project Update

- Improved design  
- Displays a different quote on each click  
- Quote source: [Goodreads Quotes](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes)  
- Integrated **Particles.js** for background animation  
- Used Bootstrapâ€™s built-in `fade` and `show` classes for transitions  

---

## Note

This project is simple, yet it has potential. I definitely plan to grow it and add more features in the future, such as:

- Backend integration  
- User authentication  
- Database support to store a large collection of quotes  
- Daily quote system  
- Notifications and reminders  
- And much more...
